[![made-with-ruby](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Ruby-red)](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

Generate full-featured API servers for your database tables in seconds.

# About
This project aims to provide a simple way to generate RESTful APIs for your database tables with mininal effort. Just enter the database connection details and let AutoREST do the rest.

# Features
- Supports major databases (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
- Can serve multiple tables at once

# Installation
This tool is available as a Ruby gem. To install it, run:

```bash
gem install autorest
```

The tool comes with a powerful CLI that is used to interactively create your restful APIs.

# Quickstart
To get your hand on AutoREST, run:

```bash
autorest boot sqlite://[path/to/sqlite.db]/[table_name]
```

If you want to try with MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle, run:

```bash
autorest boot mysql://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]/[table_name]
```

for PostgreSQL (or) Oracle, use `pg://` (or) `orcl://` respectively instead of `mysql://`

Access the server at `http://localhost:7914`
